# Web Lab Ontologies

A central home for ontology definition files which define metadata tags used to label CellML files. The labelled CellML files can then be used by both [Chaste](https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki), [ApPredict](https://chaste.github.io/projects/ap-predict/) and the [ModellingWebLab](www.github.com/ModellingWebLab) by them referring to this central ontology repository.

There are a large number of electrophysiology models already labelled with these annotations at https://github.com/chaste/cellml.

To learn more about possible annotations of CellML files with this ontology please see [the Chaste user guides](https://chaste.github.io/docs/user-guides/code-generation-from-cellml/#model-annotation-with-rdf), and to use a drag-and-drop tool for doing the annotation itself please upload a model to the [Cardiac Electrophysiology Web Lab](https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/WebLab).

`oxford_metadata.ttl` is the human-readable file which should be updated.

After updates, run 
`python ttl2rdf.py oxford-metadata.ttl oxford-metadata.rdf`
to update the RDF file to match, and commit both.

This should now work with python3.
